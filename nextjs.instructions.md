## 1. Component Design Principles
- **Single Responsibility Principle**: Each component should do one thing. If it grows too complex, break it into smaller subcomponents.  
  [Source](https://react.dev/learn/thinking-in-react)
- **Component Hierarchy**: Start by drawing boxes around every UI element in your mockup and naming them. Arrange components in a hierarchy that matches your data model.
- **Reusability**: Build components that can be reused across your app. Pass data via props and avoid duplicating logic.
- **Props vs State**: Use props for data passed from parent to child. Use state for data that changes over time and is local to a component.

## 2. When to Create New Components
- **Break UI into Logical Pieces**: If a part of your UI is repeated, complex, or has its own logic, make it a separate component.
- **Data Mapping**: If your data model has distinct entities, create components for each entity.
- **Conditional Complexity**: If a section of JSX has complex conditional logic, consider extracting it into its own component.
- **Component Growth**: If a component grows too large or has multiple responsibilities, split it up.

## 3. State Management
- **Minimal State**: Only store the minimal, non-redundant state needed. Compute derived data on-demand.

- **Lift State Up**: If multiple components need to share state, move it to their closest common parent.
- **Preserve and Reset State**: Use keys to force React to reset state when needed (e.g., switching between users in a chat app).
- **Reducers and Context**: For complex state logic, use reducers (`useReducer`) and context to avoid prop drilling and keep logic maintainable.

## 4. Conditional Rendering
- **Use JavaScript Control Flow**: Use `if` statements, ternary (`? :`), and logical AND (`&&`) for conditional rendering.  
  [Source](https://react.dev/learn/conditional-rendering)
- **Return `null` for No Render**: If a component should not render anything, return `null`.
- **Avoid Duplication**: If conditional branches return similar JSX, extract common parts to variables or child components.

## 5. Project Structure (Next.js)
- **File-System Routing**: Use folders and files to define routes.  
  [Source](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing)
- **Pages and Layouts**:  
  - `app/page.tsx` for main pages.
  - `app/layout.tsx` for shared layouts.
  - Nest folders for nested routes and layouts.
- **Dynamic Segments**: Use `[param]` folders for dynamic routes (e.g., `/blog/[slug]`).
- **Shared UI**: Place reusable UI components in a `components/` directory.

## 6. Data Fetching (Next.js)
- **Server Components**: Fetch data directly in async server components using `fetch` or database clients.  
  [Source](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching)
- **Client Components**: Use SWR or React Query for client-side data fetching and caching.
- **Streaming and Suspense**: Use `<Suspense>` and `loading.js` for streaming data and showing loading states.
- **Parallel and Sequential Fetching**: Use `Promise.all` for parallel requests, and sequence requests only when necessary.

## 7. Formatting and Code Quality
- **Consistent Formatting**: Use Prettier and ESLint to enforce code style and catch errors.  
  [Source](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/configuring)
- **TypeScript**: Use TypeScript for type safety and better developer experience.
- **Naming Conventions**: Use PascalCase for components, camelCase for variables and functions.
- **Avoid Magic Numbers/Strings**: Use constants for repeated values.
- **Documentation**: Add comments for complex logic and document component props and state.

## Example Workflow for Building a React/Next.js Feature
1. **Start with a mockup or data model.**
2. **Break the UI into a component hierarchy.**
3. **Build a static version of the UI with reusable components.**
4. **Identify minimal state and where it should live.**
5. **Add interactivity and inverse data flow (event handlers).**
6. **Organize files according to Next.js conventions.**
7. **Use ESLint and Prettier for formatting and code quality.**
8. **Test thoroughly and refactor for clarity and maintainability.**

## Summary
- Break UI into logical, reusable components.
- Store only minimal, non-redundant state.
- Use Next.js file-system routing and layouts for structure.
- Fetch data in the right place (server or client).
- Use formatting and linting tools for code quality.
- Document and test your code.
